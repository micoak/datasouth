## Welcome to Datasouth on GitHub Pages

A collection of documents and links to helpful open source resources. Github uses jekyll in the background to generate a website from the markdown pages below. [see here](https://chryket.github.io/datasouth/). To get a local version working check the docs [here](https://help.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/testing-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll).
