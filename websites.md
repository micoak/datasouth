### Jekyll on Github Pages

To locate a theme’s files on your computer: [from here](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/themes/)

I ran into a bit of trouble changing themes with github pages. Specifically the `Invalid theme folder: _includes` message. looks fine locally but fails on ghpages.

to fix I followed these steps

 Run `bundle info --path` followed by the name of the theme’s gem, e.g., `bundle info --path minima` for Jekyll’s default theme.

you can see whats in the themes folders
`ls $(bundle info --path tactile)`
`assets  _layouts  LICENSE  README.md  _sass`
